## Blog list

### About

This is an API for a bloglist, where users can store their favourite blogs. Other users can visit them and upvote or downvote, stackoverflow style.

### Usage

After cloning this repository and navigating to `bloglist`, follow the steps listed below for local development

First, you'll need to source the `script.sh` file, or you could export the variables (_MONGO_URI_ and _PORT_) on your own in your shell, however, using the script is much faster.

```shell
[user@host]─[/home/user/Desktop/bloglist]
└──╼ # source script.sh

[user@host]─[/home/user/Desktop/bloglist]
└──╼ # npm install

[user@host]─[/home/user/Desktop/bloglist]
└──╼ # npm run dev
```
